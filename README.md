# GoldBadgeConsoleApplicationChallenge

This is a collection of 8 console applications, each using different elements or a different approach.

                     ****Challenge 1*****
                     
My approach for Challenge 1 was to put most of the code and logic in the repo as opposed to the UI.  This was my first time trying a program this way.  I like how clean it kept
the UI.  I also created and used more Helper Methods than I had previously.  This drastically reduced the need for redundant code.  Another first for me was using a dictionary.
I wanted to try it out to see how convenient the key value feature would be.  This might not have been the most ideal program to implement it but it gave me some good experience
working with it.  The dicitonary used was in the form <string, object>.  I used string so I would not have to do so many Int.TryParse, but I had wanted it to be a numerical
key system and since the user is inputting numbers, I ended up having to parse a bunch of ReadLines.  I am realizeing that maybe there is no way around lots of parsing.  To
do over again, I might use a <int, object > style.  

The program is clean and fully functional and accounts for all invalid user input.
